# Tree Kit

This lib is a toolbox that provide functions to deal with nested `Object` structure.
It features the classic `.extend()` method, but provide a whole bunch of options that the others library lack.

* License: MIT
* Current status: beta
* Platform: Node.js only (browser support is planned)



# Install

Use Node Package Manager:

    npm install tree-kit



# .extend( options , target , source1 , [source2] , [...] )

* options `Object` extend options, it supports the properties:
	* own `boolean` only copy owned properties from the sources
	* deep `boolean` perform a deep (recursive) extend
	* move `boolean` move properties from the sources object to the target object (delete properties from the sources object)
	* preserve `boolean` existing properties in the target object will not be overwritten
	* nofunc `boolean` skip properties that are functions
	* proto `boolean` alter the target's prototype so that it matches the source's prototype.
	  It forces option 'own'. Specifying multiple sources does not make sens here.
	* inherit `boolean` make the target inherit from the source (the target's prototype will be the source itself, not its prototype).
	  It forces option 'own' and disable 'proto'. Specifying multiple sources does not make sens here.
	* skipRoot `boolean` prevent the prototype of the target **root** object from mutation.
	  Only nested objects' prototype will be mutated.
* target `Object` the target of the extend, properties will be copied to this object
* source `Object` the source of the extend, properties will be copied from this object

This is a full-featured *extend* of an object with one or more source object.

It is easily translated from jQuery-like *extend()*:
* `extend( target , source )` translate into `tree.extend( null , target , source )`
* `extend( true , target , source )` translate into `tree.extend( { deep: true } , target , source )`

However, here we have full control over what will be extended and how.

By default, `tree.extend()` will copy all enumerable properties, and perform a shallow copy (a nested object is not cloned, it remains
a reference of the original one).

With the *deep* option, a deep copy is performed, so nested object are cloned too.

The *own* option clone only owned properties from the sources, properties that are part of the source's prototype would not be copied/cloned.

You can also clone an object as close as it is possible to do in javascript by doing this:
```js
var clone = tree.extend( { deep: true, proto: true } , null , original ) ;
```
Also please note that:
* properties that are not enumerable will never be cloned: javascript does not provide a way to search for them
* design pattern using private members cannot be truly cloned since those private members are hidden in an inaccessible closure's scope

Mixing *inherit* and *deep* provides a nice multi-level inheritance.
